# LunarLanderSAO

A SAO for the Lunar Lander badge

The schematic is [here](/schematic.pdf "here").

## Assembling the kit

If you have a LunarLander SAO kit, it will have the attiny85, the capacitors and the resistors already soldered to the back of the badge ![SAO1](/images/back.jpg "back of the SAO kit")

You will be soldering six LEDs to the front of the badge, and the SAO connector to the back.

We'll start with the LEDs.  Take a close look at the LEDs; you will see two tiny green dots at one end ![LED1](/images/zoomedLED.jpg "zooming")

LEDs must be soldered to the SAO with the correct polarity; this means the green dots must point towards the top of the lander for the LEDs at the sides (on the pads marked with green arrows), and face outwards for the ones at the lower edge (as shown with the green arrows).   ![LED2](/images/LEDs_attached.jpg "LEDs attached").

The SAO connector is a keyed connector that provides power for the badge.  Some SAOs are more sophisticated and use the remaining four pins on the connector to interact with a badge.

The connector is simple through-hole soldering.
